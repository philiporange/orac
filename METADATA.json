  "long_description": "Orac is a comprehensive LLM framework that enables developers to work with OpenAI-compatible APIs through a YAML-driven configuration system. It provides multiple levels of abstraction including prompts for single LLM interactions, flows for multi-step workflows with dependency management, autonomous ReAct-style agents that can reason and use tools, collaborative multi-agent teams, and executable Python skills. The framework includes a modern CLI with resource-action command structure, a Python API for programmatic access, multi-provider support (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Azure, OpenRouter, custom), conversation history tracking with SQLite, file attachment support for local and remote files, and comprehensive logging. It's designed for building complex AI applications from simple prompts to sophisticated autonomous agent systems.",
