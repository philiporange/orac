  Culinary Journey Team Guidelines:
  - The journey must flow naturally between contiguous countries
  - Each course should authentically represent its country of origin
  - The overall menu should be cohesive despite crossing borders
  - Include cultural context and storytelling in the presentation
  - Balance flavors and textures across the entire meal
  - Consider seasonal ingredients and regional specialties
